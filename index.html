                    <h2>
                        Prem Mandir in Vrindavan was built to celebrate pure love—especially the divine love between
                        Lord Krishna and Radha. The idea is to inspire people to feel that love in their hearts and live
                        with kindness and devotion. Every carving and sculpture shows stories of Krishna's life,
                        reminding us of joy, compassion, and simple devotion. The peaceful gardens and beautiful light
                        show make it a place where you can relax, feel connected, and reflect on what love really means.
